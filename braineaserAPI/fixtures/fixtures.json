The idea behind inner child work is to provide nurturing to the emotional part of yourself that is psychologically young and vulnerable. Seeing yourself in this way helps you develop empathy for yourself in a way which might otherwise be difficult. Many times, emotional upset is tied to self-judgement, and often this has its roots in childhood.
